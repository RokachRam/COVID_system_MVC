1. test create site with and without address
2. controller: take care of isolation logic based only on isolation date attribute
3. Lists to save:
    list of SickInLocation: List[SickInLocation] (saves all the locations a sick person visited)
    list of Suspects: List[Suspects] (saves all the Suspects who encountered (hence encounterID) sick)
    list of Test: List[Test]

4. when a update-lab-test command happens - update both test list and person.sick

5. validate arguments
6. add checks to failed operations on controller-view integration (like we did in Update-sick-encounter-details)
