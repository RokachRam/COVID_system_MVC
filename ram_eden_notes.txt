1. test create site with and without address
2. controller: take care of isolation logic based only on isolation date attribute
3. Lists to save:
    list of SickInLocation: List[SickInLocation] (saves all the locations a sick person visited)
    list of Suspects: List[Suspects] (saves all the Suspects who encountered (hence encounterID) sick)
    list of Test: List[Test]

5. add 'interviewed' attribute to Person
6. in Suspect class, to add func get_if_infected_by_someone (return sick)
